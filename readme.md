# SLimMPX Connector PCB

This PCB simplifies the installation of Multiplex-connectors in the slim fuselages of newer F3X-type gliders, where the reduced width has made it difficult to install the connectors flush with the fuselage.

In the folder "Gerber", you will find the necessary files to produce the PCBs. They should be accepted by most PCB manufacturing services. The Gerber files are not panelised, this means that if you order one PCB, you will get one unit. Most fab houses however offer an automatic panelisation option, which I suggest you use: this way, one PCB will countain a grid of small circuits, and you can get tens of units for basically the same price.

In the folder "KiCAD", you will find all the CAD files to modify the design. As the name of the folder implies, the files are for the EDA software KiCAD, which is free and Open-source. This will also allow you to generate the Gerber files yourself, should you have the need to modify any settings.

Feel free to give feedback and suggest any improvements!
