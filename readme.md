# SlimMPX Connector PCB

This PCB simplifies the installation of Multiplex-connectors in the slim fuselages of newer F3X-type gliders, where the reduced width has made it difficult to install the connectors flush with the fuselage.

## Gerber Files
In this folder you will find the files necessary to produce the PCBs. They should be accepted by most PCB manufacturing services. The Gerber files are not panelised, this means that if you order one PCB, you will get one unit. Most fab houses however offer an automatic panelisation option, which I suggest you use: this way, one PCB will countain a array of small circuits, and you can get tens of units for basically the same price.

## KiCAD project
In the folder "KiCAD", you will find all the CAD files to modify the design. As the name implies, the files are for the EDA software KiCAD, which is free and Open-source. These files will edit the design, and allow you to generate the Gerber files yourself, should you have the need to modify any settings.

Feel free to give feedback and suggest any improvements!
